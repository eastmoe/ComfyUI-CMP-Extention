[中文](./README_zh.md)

## Introduction
ComfyUI-CMP-Extention is a ComfyUI acceleration extension designed specifically for the **170HX GPU**. Based on research findings from **[Insert Paper Name Here]**, it enhances inference performance by optimizing specific operators. This extension requires the use of the [cmp_ext](https://github.com/eastmoe/cmp_ext) library.

## Installation

1. Ensure that [cmp_ext](https://github.com/eastmoe/cmp_ext) is installed and configured.
2. Navigate to the `custom_nodes` directory of your ComfyUI installation.
3. Run the following command to clone this extension:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eastmoe/ComfyUI-CMP-Extention
```

4. Restart ComfyUI.

## Usage

1. In ComfyUI, locate the **CmpExt3ControlPanelNode** within the **CmpExt3** category in the node menu.
2. Insert this node **after the model loader** and **before the sampler**.
3. Check or uncheck the operator types you wish to optimize as needed.
4. Connect the nodes:
   - Connect the output of the model loader node to the `model` input (optional)
   - Connect the output of the CLIP loader node to the `clip` input (optional)
   - Connect the output of the VAE loader node to the `vae` input (optional)

## Node Parameters Description

### Core Operators
- **Ops: Linear**: Linear layer optimization (Enabled by default)
- **Ops: Conv2d**: Convolutional layer optimization (Enabled by default)
- **Ops: ConvTranspose2d (VAE Upscale)**: Transposed convolution optimization, used for VAE upscaling (Enabled by default)
- **Ops: BMM (Attention)**: Batch matrix multiplication optimization in attention mechanisms (Enabled by default)

### Normalization Layers
- **Norm: GroupNorm (VAE)**: Group normalization optimization, primarily used for VAE (Enabled by default)
- **Norm: LayerNorm (CLIP/Transformer)**: Layer normalization optimization, used for CLIP/Transformer (Enabled by default)

### Activation Functions
- **Act: SiLU / Swish (VAE Main Suspect!)**: SiLU/Swish activation function optimization, the primary optimization target in VAE (Enabled by default)
- **Act: GELU (CLIP/UNet)**: GELU activation function optimization, used for CLIP/UNet (Enabled by default)
- **Act: Softmax (Attention)**: Softmax activation function optimization, used in attention mechanisms (Enabled by default)
- **Act: Mish**: Mish activation function optimization (Disabled by default)
- **Act: Softplus**: Softplus activation function optimization (Disabled by default)
- **Act: Softsign**: Softsign activation function optimization (Disabled by default)

## Notes

1. This extension is specifically optimized for the **170HX GPU**. Other graphics card models may not achieve the same results or may encounter compatibility issues.
2. If you experience performance degradation or instability, try disabling some of the operator optimizations.
